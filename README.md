Project Overview
The AI-Assisted Gamified Learning Platform is designed to enhance student engagement and motivation in learning programming.
It combines AI-driven personalized feedback with gamification elements such as points, streaks, badges, and leaderboards to make coding lessons more enjoyable and rewarding.
Students can learn interactively, while teachers monitor progress and assign exercises based on each learner’s performance.
Admins manage accounts, classes, and system updates to ensure a smooth and modern learning experience.
