```
php artisan make:seeder ChirpSeeder
```
- Generates a seeder file to insert some sample data into tables
- Can understand as script file to run multiple tinker commands at once

```
public function run(): void

---
- `User::count() < 3 ? collect() : User::take(3)->get()`
	- Conditional operation
	- if number of users < 3, execute `collect()`
	- else get 3 users from database
- `collect()`
	- Function to create new Collection instance
	- aka something like `Array()`
- `User::create()`: see tinker

```
$users->random()->chirps()->create([
                'message' => $message,
                'created_at' => now()->subMinutes(rand(5, 1440)),
            ]);
```
- `$users->random()` : get random user
- `$users->random()->chirps()` : access random user's chirps
- `'created_at' => now()->subMinutes(rand(5, 1440))` : setting timestamps to random times to look more realistic
